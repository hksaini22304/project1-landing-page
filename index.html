                    <p class="due-date">Due: August 28, 2025</p>
                    <p class="project-description">In this basic lab, I tried copying a static composition using what I know about HTML and CSS. The aim was to accurately replicate an existing design mockup, with emphasis on layout structure, typography, and style accuracy. This exercise helped me improve my ability to comprehend a design and bring it to life on the web while also reinforcing recommended practices in front-end development.</p>

                    <p class="due-date">Due: September 4, 2025</p>
                    <p class="project-description">In this lab, I looked at current CSS layout approaches like Flexbox and Grid to develop responsive, well-structured web designs. The emphasis was on knowing how to efficiently align, distribute, and arrange content across many screen sizes. By using these layout approaches, I was able to practice creating adaptable page layouts that maintained visual harmony, flexibility, and clean design, all of which are necessary abilities for professional web development.</p>

                    <p class="due-date">Due: September 11, 2025</p>
                    <p class="project-description">For this lab, I created a landing page for an imitation cosmetics company with many major components, including a hero banner, product mockups, an about section, a contact form, and an email newsletter submission. To bring the site to life, I used CSS transitions and animations, as well as a fluid scrolling brand display to replicate press and blog content. This project enabled me to blend layout design with interactive motion, resulting in a polished landing page that looks like a professional company website.</p>
